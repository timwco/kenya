        <h3>More About Our Trip</h3>
        <p>In 2014, Steph began volunteering on the communications team of Canopy Life Academy. When the school opened in 2015, we joined the sponsor family of a 4th grade student named Rose. Now in 5th grade, it is a joy for us to see how she is growing both in her academic knowledge and her understanding of a God who loves her. <p>
        <p>This summer, from June 21–July 3, we have the awesome privilege to travel to Kenya to spend time with the students, teachers, and staff of Canopy Life Academy. School will be in session while we are there, which will provide the opportunity to experience the school first-hand and to meet Rose and her classmates face-to-face. We will also get to spend time in Parker Hill’s partner village of Karagoto.</p>
        <p>Steph’s main role on the home team has been to tell the stories of Canopy Life’s students and partners. The school has been near-and-dear to our hearts since before its doors even opened, and Steph is thrilled to finally get to write about our own experiences at the school. She hopes you will sign up for our email newsletter. She’ll keep you updated on how you can pray for us and Canopy Life, as well as share what is happening while we’re on the ground in Kenya.</p>
        <p>We also ask if you will consider partnering with us by giving toward our journey. Our goal is to raise a combined total of $6,000. More than anything, we want to say thank you for the ongoing support and friendship you already show in our lives. We’re beyond grateful for you and so excited to share this next, God-sized adventure with you.</p>
