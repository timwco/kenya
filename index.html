        <h3>More About Our Trip</h3>
        <p>This summer, Tim and I are going to Kenya with Canopy Life! It’ll be our first time out of the country as a couple, and we’re filled with anticipation for the opportunity to serve and grow together.<p>
        <p>Since 2014, I have been a part of Canopy Life’s home team, spending several hours a month writing about the school, learning about Kenyan education, and telling the stories of our pint-sized students. Tim and I sponsor a student at the school and have seen her world through a 13-inch screen via Skype. It’s a dream of ours to meet Rose and her classmates face-to-face, exchange high fives and smiles, and be part of their classroom environment.</p>
        <p class="standout"><a target="_blank" href=" http://stephwhitacre.com/2016/02/29/were-going-to-kenya/">Read more of our story in my blog post We’re Going to Kenya!</a></p>
        <p>Tim and I would like to invite you to consider supporting our journey to Kenya by signing up for email updates, giving financially (our goal is to raise $6000), and telling the Canopy Life story to others. The school has been near-and-dear to our hearts since before its doors even opened, and it’s a privilege for us to get to experience it first-hand.</p>
        <p>Thank you so much for your support and being a part of helping us make this amazing dream a reality.</p>
